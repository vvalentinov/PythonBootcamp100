# 🎯 Day Twenty Eight: Tkinter, Dynamic Typing & the Pomodoro GUI App

Today’s session was all about hands-on **GUI development with Tkinter** and **Dynamic Typing** in Python! We explored how Python handles variable types dynamically and applied our knowledge by building a Pomodoro Timer App—a tool designed to boost productivity using the **Pomodoro Technique**.

### Key Takeaways 💡

✅ **Dynamic Typing** – Understanding how Python assigns types at runtime and the flexibility it offers.  
✅ **Tkinter GUI Development** – Creating interactive applications with buttons, labels, and timers.  
✅ **The Pomodoro Timer App** – Implementing a countdown timer with work and break intervals to help manage focus and efficiency.

By the end of the day, we had a fully functional Pomodoro Timer with a clean UI, helping us reinforce both theoretical and practical concepts. 💡⏳
