# ðŸŽ¯ Day Eleven: The Blackjack Capstone Project

Day Eleven is all about tying together the skills youâ€™ve mastered so far by building a fun and interactive Blackjack game.  
In this project, youâ€™ll use variables to manage the gameâ€™s state, lists to track cards, loops to handle gameplay mechanics, and functions to break the game into logical components.  
This capstone is designed to challenge you while reinforcing key programming concepts in a practical and engaging way.  
As you build the game, youâ€™ll see how these fundamental tools work together to create a dynamic program.  
By the end of the day, youâ€™ll not only have a working Blackjack game but also a deeper understanding of how to structure and build more complex projects in Python.
