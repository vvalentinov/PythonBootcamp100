# ðŸŽ¯ Day Three: Control Flow and Logical Operators

Learn how to make decisions in your code using if, else, and elif statements.  
Explore logical operators (and, or, not) to create more complex conditions.  
Use these tools to build dynamic programs that respond to user input or changing data.

## ðŸ“š Knowledge Gained

1. **Conditional Statements**  
*Tools like if, else, and elif to control the flow of your program based on conditions.*
2. **Logical Operators**  
*And, or, and not to combine or modify conditions for more complex decision-making.*
3. **Code Blocks**  
*Groups of statements that execute together, defined by indentation in Python.*
4. **Scope**  
*Determines where variables and functions can be accessed within your program (local vs. global).*
