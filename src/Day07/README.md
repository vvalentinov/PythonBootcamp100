# ðŸŽ¯ Day Seven: Hangman Project

On Day 07 of the bootcamp, I built a Hangman game using fundamental Python concepts like loops (for and while), the random module, lists, and variables.  
The game generates a random word and allows players to guess letters one by one.  
The game tracks incorrect guesses, deducts lives accordingly, and updates the displayed word with correct guesses.

Throughout the project, I focused on:
- Using while loops to repeatedly ask for guesses until the player either wins or runs out of lives.
- Using the random module to select a word randomly from a predefined list.
- Manipulating lists to store the current state of the word and update it with correctly guessed letters.

This project helped solidify my understanding of key Python concepts like controlling flow with loops, working with lists to manage game state, and using variables to track the player's progress. It was an excellent exercise in using the basics of Python to build a fully functional game.
