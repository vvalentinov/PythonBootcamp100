# ðŸŽ¯ Day Twelve: Scope & Number Guessing Game

On Day Twelve, we dove into the concept of scope in Python, learning about local scope and global scope and understanding when variables are accessible within different parts of our code.  
We explored how to use constants effectively in the global scope, following best practices by defining them in uppercase.  
To put our knowledge into practice, we built a simple yet fun Number Guessing Game, which challenged us to apply our understanding of variable visibility and scope.  
This project reinforced the importance of keeping code organized and managing variable lifecycles.  
Overall, it was a productive day combining theoretical learning with hands-on application.
