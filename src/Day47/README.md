# ðŸŽ¯ Day Fourty Seven: Create an Automated Amazon Price Checker

Today, we built a powerful Amazon Price Checker using Python, BeautifulSoup, and smtplib to track product prices and send email alerts when the price drops below a target value.

### What We Covered:

âœ… Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup â€“ Extracting product details and prices from an Amazon product page.  
âœ… Handling Dynamic Content â€“ Understanding why some prices donâ€™t show up and exploring workarounds.  
âœ… Email Automation with smtplib â€“ Sending price drop notifications directly to our inbox.  
âœ… Environment Variables with dotenv â€“ Keeping sensitive information like email credentials secure.  
âœ… Automating Price Tracking â€“ Setting up the script to run regularly for real-time alerts.

By the end of the day, we had a fully functional price-tracking bot that helps us grab the best Amazon deals automatically! ðŸš€
