# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty Six: Stock Trading News Alert Project

Today we built a Stock Trading News Alert Project that integrates financial data with news headlines.  
The goal of this project was to track stock price movements and send alerts when significant changes occur.

### What We Covered:
âœ… Fetching real-time stock data using APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage).  
âœ… Retrieving relevant financial news using a news API (e.g., NewsAPI).  
âœ… Implementing logic to detect stock price fluctuations.  
âœ… Automating email or SMS alerts when a stock price change exceeds a threshold.  
âœ… Formatting news snippets to be sent as notifications.

### Key Takeaways:
- Learned how to work with external APIs to fetch dynamic data.
- Practiced handling JSON responses and extracting useful information.
- Improved automation skills by setting up alerts.
- Strengthened Python skills in working with data, logic, and API integration.

By the end of the day, we had a functional stock news alert system that can be customized for any stock ticker. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
