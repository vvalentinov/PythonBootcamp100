# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty Two: Send Email(smtplib) and Manage Dates(datetime) ðŸ“§ðŸ“…

Today was an exciting day in our Python bootcamp as we took a deep dive into email automation and date/time management! ðŸš€

### ðŸ“§ Sending Emails with smtplib

We started by exploring the ```smtplib``` module, which allows us to send emails directly from Python. We learned how **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** works and how to configure an SMTP server for sending messages. Here are some of the key concepts we covered:

âœ… Setting up an SMTP connection using ```smtplib```  
âœ… Logging into an email account securely  
âœ… Composing and formatting email messages  
âœ… Sending emails to single and multiple recipients  

This knowledge is incredibly useful for automating tasks like sending notifications, alerts, or even newsletters from Python scripts! ðŸ’Œ

### ðŸ“… Working with Dates and Times using datetime

After learning about email sending, we shifted our focus to the datetime module. Understanding how to work with dates and times is essential for many applications, from scheduling tasks to logging events.
