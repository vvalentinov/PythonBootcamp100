# ðŸŽ¯ Day Eight: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

On Day Eight of the Python Bootcamp, we delved into function parameters, learning how to pass data into functions for more flexibility and reusability.  
We explored the basics of defining functions with different parameter types, enhancing our ability to write dynamic code.  
Additionally, we applied our new skills to implement a Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique, giving us hands-on experience with both functions and string manipulation.  
By the end of the day, we had a solid understanding of using parameters in functions to create more efficient and versatile Python programs.
