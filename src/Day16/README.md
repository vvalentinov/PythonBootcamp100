# ðŸŽ¯ Day Sixteen: Object Oriented Programming

Today's focus was all about diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an essential paradigm in programming that allows us to design and organize code around objects and their interactions.  
This marks an exciting shift in how we approach problem-solving in Python.

## What we learned:

1. **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    - We explored the fundamentals of OOP, including the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
    - We learned how OOP enables us to model real-world entities in code and promotes reusability, scalability, and clarity in our projects.
2. **Working with the ```turtle``` Module**
    - We got hands-on with the turtle graphics library in Python, which allows us to create visually engaging graphics and animations.
    - Using the turtle library, we can practice OOP by controlling objects (like a Turtle) with attributes and methods to draw, move, and change visual properties on the screen.
3. **The Python Package Index (PyPI)**
    - We were introduced to PyPI, a repository of Python packages and libraries.
    - We learned how to install external packages using pip, import them into our projects, and leverage them to expand Python's functionality.

### Project of the Day

For our main project, we revisited and enhanced a previous challenge: the Coffee Machine Project.  
This time, we restructured the entire program using the principles of OOP.

- **Before OOP**: The original coffee machine was built using procedural programming, with functions driving the logic.
- **After OOP**: We refactored the program to use classes and objects, making the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain.
