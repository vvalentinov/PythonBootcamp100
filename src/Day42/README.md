# 🎯 Day Fourty Two: Web Foundation - Intermediate HTML 🌍

Today’s session took our HTML skills to the next level! We started by understanding the essential HTML boilerplate, setting up the foundation for every webpage. From there, we explored the list element, learning how to structure both ordered and unordered lists effectively.

We also covered the importance of nesting and indentation, ensuring our code remains clean, readable, and well-organized. Next, we dived into anchor elements (`<a>`), mastering how to create links that connect pages, open external resources, and navigate smoothly. Finally, we worked with image elements (`<img>`), learning how to properly embed and optimize images for the web.

It was a solid step forward in building strong, structured, and functional web pages! 🚀
