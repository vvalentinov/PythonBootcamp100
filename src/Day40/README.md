# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty Nine: Capstone Part 2 - Flight Deal Finder

Today's project is about an automated flight deal finderâ€”a powerful script that searches for the best flight deals and alerts you when prices drop. Whether you love to travel or want to explore real-world automation, this project will take your Python skills to the next level.

This program integrates multiple APIs to fetch, process, and notify users about flight deals. By the end of the day, you'll have a fully functional script that can track airfare prices and send you alerts when flights become cheaper. This is an amazing way to combine Python programming with real-world applications!

### What We Practised:

ðŸ”¹ API Integration: You'll work with multiple APIs, including:  
 - **Amadeus Flight Search** API to find flights.
 - **Sheety API** to store and manage city and price data in Google Sheets.
 - **Twilio API** to send SMS notifications when a deal is found.  

 ðŸ”¹ Data Management: Learn how to fetch, update, and maintain flight data efficiently.  
ðŸ”¹ Flight Search Automation: Implement a robust system that continuously scans for flight deals based on set criteria.  
ðŸ”¹ Sending SMS Notifications: Use Twilio to instantly alert users when a cheap flight is found.  
ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Work with multiple Python classes (```DataManager```, ```FlightSearch```, ```FlightData```, and ```NotificationManager```) to keep your code organized and modular.  
ðŸ”¹ Using Environment Variables (```dotenv```): Learn how to securely store API keys and credentials to keep them safe.
