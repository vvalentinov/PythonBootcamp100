# 🎯 Day Fourty One: Web Foundation - Introduction To Html 🌍

Today, we took our first step into web development by exploring how the internet works. We learned about the relationship between web servers and clients (browsers), understanding how they communicate to deliver web pages.

We explored the holy trinity of web development:  
✨ **HTML** - The backbone that structures content 🏗️  
🎨 **CSS** - The magic that styles everything 🎨  
⚡ **JavaScript** - The brains that bring interactivity 🧠

Focusing on **HTML**, we discovered how it helps create structured web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, breaks, and horizontal lines. This was our first step into the world of web development, and there's so much more ahead! 🚀
