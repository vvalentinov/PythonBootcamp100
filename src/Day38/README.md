# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty Eight: Workout Tracking With Google Sheets

Today, we dove into integrating APIs to build a Workout Tracking App. We explored the Nutrionix API, which allows us to analyze natural language input to extract workout details, and the Sheety API, which lets us send data to a Google Sheets document for easy tracking.

### What We Learned

âœ… How to send POST requests to the Nutrionix API to process workout descriptions and return exercise data.  
âœ… How to structure API requests using headers and authentication keys.  
âœ… How to extract exercise details like name, duration, and calories burned from the response.  
âœ… How to use the Sheety API to log workout data into Google Sheets.  
âœ… How to work with environment variables for secure API key storage.  
âœ… How to format date and time using Pythonâ€™s datetime module.

### Project: Workout Tracker

ðŸ”¹ Takes user input describing a workout (e.g., "Ran 5km and did 30 minutes of yoga").  
ðŸ”¹ Sends the input to Nutrionix, which returns structured exercise data.  
ðŸ”¹ Extracts key details like exercise name, duration, and calories burned.  
ðŸ”¹ Uses Sheety to log this data into a Google Sheets document.

This project was a great hands-on experience in API integration, data processing, and automationâ€”turning simple text input into structured, trackable workout logs. ðŸš€
