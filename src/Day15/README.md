# üéØ Day Fifteen: Coffee Machine Project ‚òïÔ∏è

Today, we embarked on an exciting challenge by building an interactive Coffee Machine Project.  
While no brand-new programming concepts were introduced, this project provided an excellent opportunity to consolidate and apply the skills we‚Äôve learned so far.  
The goal was to design a fully functional, text-based coffee machine simulation that is both intuitive and realistic, giving us hands-on practice in implementing logic, user interaction, and resource management in Python.  

This project is a culmination of several concepts, including the use of functions, conditionals, loops, dictionaries, and modular code organization.  
Through this task, we aimed to focus on problem-solving and critical thinking while writing clean, reusable, and efficient Python code.
