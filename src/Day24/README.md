# 🎯 Day Twenty Four: Files, Directories, and Paths 📂🐍

Today's bootcamp session was all about working with files, directories, and paths in Python! We explored how to read from files, write to files, and manage data storage effectively. This is an essential skill for handling user data, saving configurations, and even logging events in real-world applications. We also discussed different file modes, such as reading (r), writing (w), and appending (a), and how to handle potential errors using exception handling.

To put our new knowledge into practice, we made an exciting upgrade to our Snake Game project! 🎮✨ Now, instead of losing our high score when restarting the game, we store it in a text file. Each time the game runs, it reads the high score from the file and updates it if a new record is set. This was a great hands-on experience in persisting data beyond a single program execution.

This feature might seem simple, but it’s a fundamental concept in programming—many applications rely on files to keep track of user progress, settings, or saved data. Now, we can take these skills forward into more advanced topics like working with CSV files, databases, and even cloud storage! 🌍💾

## 📚 Knowledge Gained

1. **Working With Files**  
*We learned how to read from and write to files in Python, enabling us to store and retrieve data for persistence. This skill is essential for handling user information, saving progress, and logging data in various applications.*
2. **Working With Directories**  
*We explored how to navigate directories using absolute and relative paths, giving us a better understanding of how files are organized within a system. This knowledge allows us to efficiently access, manage, and structure our programs.*
