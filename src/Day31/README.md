# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty One: Flash Card App Capstone Project

Today marks an exciting milestone in my Python bootcampâ€”Day 31, where I bring together everything Iâ€™ve learned to build a Flash Card App as my Capstone Project!

This project challenges me to apply key programming concepts, including Tkinter for GUI development, file handling for data storage, and the after() method for timed actions. The goal is to create an interactive flash card application that helps users learn new words dynamically.

Key Features Implemented:  
âœ… Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed a clean and intuitive interface using Tkinter.  
âœ… Word Database Handling: Loaded and updated a dataset of words using a CSV file.  
âœ… Card Flip Animation: Used root.after() to automatically flip cards after a delay.  
âœ… Progress Tracking: Allowed users to mark words as learned, ensuring they don't repeat.

Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned:
ðŸ”¹ Managing the timer with after() to smoothly flip cards.  
ðŸ”¹ Handling missing or corrupted CSV data gracefully.  
ðŸ”¹ Structuring the code efficiently to keep it modular and scalable.
