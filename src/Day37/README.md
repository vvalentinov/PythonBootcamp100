# 🎯 Day Thirty Seven: Habit Tracking Project

Today, we took a deeper dive into working with the ```requests``` module by exploring three important HTTP methods: **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**. These methods are crucial when interacting with web APIs, as they allow us to create, update, and delete data programmatically.

To apply what we learned, we worked with the **[Pixela API](https://pixe.la/)** 🎨—a cool service that lets users track and visualize their daily habits through pixel graphs. We practiced:

✅ POST requests to send data and create new graph entries.  
✏️ PUT requests to modify existing data.  
❌ DELETE requests to remove unwanted entries.

This hands-on experience gave us a better understanding of how APIs work beyond simple GET requests. Now, we can confidently interact with web services, automate data management, and integrate APIs into our future projects! 💡💻
