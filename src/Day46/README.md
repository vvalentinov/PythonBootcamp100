# 🎯 Day Fourty Six: Create a Spotify Playlist using the Musical Time Machine 🎵⏳

On Day 46, we combined our skills in working with APIs and web scraping to build a Musical Time Machine! 🚀 Using the `Beautiful Soup` module, we scraped historical music charts to gather song data from a specific date in the past. Then, we leveraged the Spotify API to create and populate a playlist with those songs, bringing a past era's music to life on Spotify.

### Key Concepts Practiced:

✅ Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup  
✅ Working with the Spotify API (Authentication, Playlist Creation, Track Addition)  
✅ Handling HTTP Requests & Data Parsing  
✅ Automating Playlist Generation

This project was a fun and interactive way to practice API integration while exploring the music of different decades! 🎶✨
