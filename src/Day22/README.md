# 🎯 Day Twenty Two: Pong - The Famous Arcade Game

Today, we took a trip back in time and recreated **Pong**, one of the most iconic arcade games ever made! 🏓 Using Python and the ```turtle``` module, we built a fully functional two-player game with smooth paddle movements, ball physics, and score tracking.

### What We Learned & Implemented:

✅ **Turtle Graphics** – Used the ```turtle``` module to create the paddles, ball, and game boundaries.  
✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Structured the game using classes for better organization and reusability.  
✅ **Collision Detection** – Implemented logic to detect ball bounces off paddles, walls, and missed shots.  
✅ **Keyboard Event Handling** – Used ```listen()``` and ```onkey()``` methods to capture player input and move paddles smoothly.  
✅ **Game Loop** – Designed a continuous game loop using ```while True``` and ```update()``` for real-time movement.  
✅ **Scorekeeping System** – Tracked player scores and reset the ball when a point was scored.

### 🏓 How It Works:

- The game starts with a ball bouncing between two paddles.  
- Each player controls their paddle using keyboard inputs (W/S for the left paddle, Up/Down for the right paddle).  
- If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point, and the ball resets.  
- The game continues indefinitely, making it an exciting back-and-forth challenge!

This project was a fantastic way to solidify our understanding of turtle, game logic, and OOP principles. It also demonstrated how simple physics can be implemented in a game to make interactions feel realistic. 🚀
