# ðŸŽ¯ Day Thirty Five: Keys, Authentication & Environment Variables: Send SMS

Today was all about working with third-party APIs in Python! We focused on two powerful APIsâ€”OpenWeatherMap for fetching real-time weather data and Twilio for sending SMS messages programmatically.

### What We Covered:

âœ… **OpenWeatherMap API** â€“ We learned how to make HTTP requests to retrieve weather data based on location (latitude & longitude). We explored how to parse JSON responses and extract useful information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.  
âœ… **Twilio API for SMS** â€“ Using Twilioâ€™s Python library (twilio.rest.Client), we learned how to send text messages directly from our Python scripts. We also explored Twilioâ€™s limitations for trial accounts, verified numbers, and how to troubleshoot common errors.  
âœ… **Environment Variables & API Security** â€“ Since APIs require secret keys, we learned the importance of keeping credentials safe by storing them in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in our scripts. We practiced using ```os.environ.get()``` to access these variables securely.

### Hands-On Practice:

ðŸ”¹ Made GET requests to OpenWeatherâ€™s API and displayed weather information in a user-friendly format.  
ðŸ”¹ Sent SMS messages via Twilio, handling authentication and response errors.  
ðŸ”¹ Used .env files and Pythonâ€™s os module to protect sensitive API keys.

By the end of the session, we had a solid understanding of how to integrate external APIs into Python projects, process JSON data, and securely manage API keys. ðŸš€ Looking forward to building more projects with these skills!
