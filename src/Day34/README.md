# 🎯 Day Thirty Four: API Practice - Creating a GUI Quiz App

Today was an exciting day in our Python bootcamp as we explored two important topics: **type hints** and escaping/unescaping HTML entities using the ```html``` module.

### 🏷️ Type Hints in Python

We learned about type hints, a feature that helps make our code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone. While Python is dynamically typed, adding type hints allows us to specify the expected data types of function parameters and return values. This doesn't change how Python executes the code but provides better documentation and helps tools like MyPy catch potential bugs before runtime. We practiced using type hints with int, str, float, bool.

### 🔠 Escaping & Unescaping HTML Entities

Next, we dove into handling HTML entities using Python’s built-in html module. This is especially useful when dealing with web scraping, data cleaning, or rendering text for web applications

### 🌟 Key Takeaways

🔹 Type hints improve code clarity and debugging.  
🔹 The html module is handy for web development and text sanitization.  
🔹 Understanding these concepts makes us better Python developers!
