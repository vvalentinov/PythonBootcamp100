# 🎯 Day Thirty Three: API Endpoints & API Parameters - ISS Overhead Notifier 🌍

Today was all about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)! We explored what an API is, how it works, and how we can interact with different API endpoints to fetch useful data. 🌐

We also dived into the ```requests``` module in Python, which allows us to send HTTP requests and retrieve data from APIs easily. 🔄✨

To put our new knowledge into practice, we built an **ISS Overhead Notifier** 🚀🌎—a project that fetches real-time data about the International Space Station’s location and notifies us by sending an email when it’s passing overhead! We worked with **API parameters**, making API calls dynamic by customizing requests based on our location. 📍📡
