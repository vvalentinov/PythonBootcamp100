Today was an exciting deep dive into the world of web scraping! 🌍✨ We started by understanding what web scraping is and how it can be used to extract valuable data from websites. From automating data collection to gathering insights, we explored the real-world applications of this powerful technique.

✅ Load and parse HTML content  
✅ Navigate the Document Object Model (DOM)
