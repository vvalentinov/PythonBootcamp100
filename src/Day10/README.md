# ðŸŽ¯ Day Ten: Functions with Outputs

Today, we focused on understanding functions that return values.  
Unlike functions that simply perform an action, these functions send data back to the caller, allowing us to use the result in further calculations or logic.  
We learned how to define a function with a return statement and explored how it differs from printing directly inside the function.  
This concept is fundamental for creating reusable and modular code, as it enables us to chain functions together and work with dynamic outputs.  
By practicing with real-world examples, we saw how returning values enhances the flexibility and power of our programs.
