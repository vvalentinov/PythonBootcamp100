# 🎯 Day Fourty Four: Web Foundation - Intermediate CSS 🎨💻

Today's session was all about diving deeper into CSS styling and understanding how to control the look and feel of our web pages! 🚀

We started by exploring CSS colors 🎨—learning how to use named colors, HEX codes, RGB, and HSL to bring vibrant designs to life. Then, we focused on font properties ✍️, discovering how to change font families, sizes, weights, and styles to enhance typography and readability.

A major highlight was learning how to inspect CSS in the browser 🔍 using developer tools. This skill allows us to analyze and tweak styles in real time, making debugging and design adjustments much easier! 🛠️

We also dove into the CSS Box Model 📦, breaking down how margin, padding, and borders define spacing and structure on a webpage. Understanding how these elements interact is crucial for creating well-organized, responsive layouts. 🏗️✨
