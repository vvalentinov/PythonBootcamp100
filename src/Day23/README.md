# 🎯 Day Twenty Three: The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project 🐢🚦

Today, We built the Turtle Crossing Capstone Project, combining all the skills we’ve learned in Python so far! This project uses the turtle graphics module to create a fun game where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road while avoiding moving cars. 🚗💨

### Key Concepts Applied:

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Created classes for the player, cars, and scoreboard.  
✅ Turtle Graphics – Used the turtle module to handle game visuals.  
✅ Collision Detection – Checked if the turtle collides with a car.  
✅ Event Listeners – Mapped keyboard inputs (onkey()) for movement.  
✅ Game Loop & Performance Optimization – Used tracer(0) and update() for smooth rendering.

### Challenges & Solutions:

- **Managing multiple moving cars** – Stored them in a list and updated them in a loop.
- **Speed increase per level** – Adjusted car movement speed dynamically.
- **Collision handling** – Implemented game-over logic when the turtle gets hit.
