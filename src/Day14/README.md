# ðŸŽ¯ Day Fourteen: Higher Lower Game Project

On Day Fourteen, we focused on applying our existing Python knowledge by building a simple console game inspired by [Higher or Lower](https://www.higherlowergame.com/).  
This project didn't introduce any new concepts but allowed us to practice using the skills we've learned so far, such as working with lists, dictionaries, and control flow.  
The game uses a predefined ```game_data``` list, which contains a collection of dictionaries holding all the necessary information for the comparisons.

Players are presented with two choices and must decide which option has a higher value based on the provided data.  
We implemented the logic to track player scores, handle user input, and manage the game's flow.  
This project was a fun and practical way to reinforce our understanding of Python fundamentals, improve our problem-solving skills, and gain more confidence in building functional programs from scratch.
