# ðŸŽ¯ Day Two: Understanding Data Types and How To Manipulate Strings

This is our first introduction to the basic and fundamental data types - string, int, float and boolean.  
We are also introduced to string formatting as in: f"The price is {price} dollars."  
The final project of the day is a simple Tip Calculator Project.
