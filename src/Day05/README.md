# ðŸŽ¯ Day Five: Python Loops

Today's focus is an introduction to "for" loops in Python.  
Learn how to iterate over lists efficiently and use the range() function to work with sequences of numbers.  
Explore practical examples of looping and discover how the shuffle() function can add randomness to your lists.  
This session builds a solid foundation for mastering loops in Python.
