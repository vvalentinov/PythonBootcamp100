# ðŸŽ¯ Day Seventeen: Quiz Project

Today in our Python bootcamp, we delved into the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by building a simple Quiz Project.  
The project was a hands-on application of OOP principles, allowing us to see how concepts like classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation come together to create a well-structured and scalable program.

Our Quiz Project included creating a ```Question``` class to encapsulate the data for each quiz question and a ```QuizBrain``` class to manage the flow of the quiz, such as tracking the user's progress and evaluating their answers.  
By organizing the code into these classes, we achieved a cleaner and more modular structure that made it easier to read, debug, and extend.

### Key Benefits of OOP Explored:

1. **Code Reusability**
    - The use of classes and methods made it possible to reuse components in other projects or expand the quiz with minimal additional code.
2. **Modularity**
    - Dividing the functionality into logical units (e.g., ```Question``` and ```QuizBrain```) improved maintainability and readability.
3. **Scalability**
    - With OOP, adding more features like scoring systems or time limits becomes simpler, as the structure is already designed for extension.
4. **Encapsulation**
    - By keeping the data and methods related to each class together, we protected the integrity of the program and reduced the risk of bugs.

This project was a great way to see how OOP principles streamline the development process and help build programs that are robust, efficient, and easy to manage. It was a rewarding step forward in our programming journey!
